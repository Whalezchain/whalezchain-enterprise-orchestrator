  # This is *documentation only*. Real secrets live in an offline hardwallet.
  wallet_namespace: "whalezchain://genesis/founder"
  hardwallet_boot_strategy: "one_time_qr_then_offline"
  notes: >
    The first time the hardwallet is activated, it mints the Whalezchain
    founder, treasury, and ledger wallets. After that, the same physical
    wallet is used only for signing governance operations, never minting
    again.
